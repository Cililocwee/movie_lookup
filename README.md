# MovieHound

MovieHound is an application that allows users to search for and display information about movies using The Movie DB API. The application offers two different styles for displaying movie information: a movie card format and a table format. The movie card format allows users to hover over a movie poster to reveal more information, while the table format allows users to quickly look through longer lists of movies.
